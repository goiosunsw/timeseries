# timeseries for Python

A series of objects to facilitate working with time series, meaning value corresponding to particlar instants.

Note, that unlike pandas or other data-oriented packages, time series are not encoded with datetime objects, but with simple float vectors corresponding to a time unit (seconds, hours, etc)
